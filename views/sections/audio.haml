  The van comes with an AUDIO 20 Stereo with no line-in. After adding the aux-in accessory cable I added a 12V socket to power a phone for sat nav / music player.
  
  Without a pre-amp the line-in is very quiet, I mounted one behind the panel above the glove compartment and wired it up with a 12V to 5V USB adapter. The 12V supply comes from the power supplied to the cigarette lighter which is only activated when the van ignition is on.

  The block that is already plugged in will be the same as the block on the end of your cable. You can take the pins out of the block on the end of your cable and insert them into the block that goes into the back of your stereo.

  The block is comprised of two plastic pieces, one slides horizontally out from the other, and contains the pins. Once you've taken these two apart you can use something small and sharp to press the clips that hold each pin into the block, thus releasing each pin.

  Once you've got the pins out of the block, insert them into the existing block attached to your stereo.

  In order to work out which pins go where, find the mercedes wiring diagram for your stereo head unit.

  Pins for AUDIO 20:

  <pre>
  3  - AUX1_IN Shield
  4  - AUX1_IN LEFT   (White)
  9  - AUX1_IN Ground (Black)
  10 - AUX1_IN Right  (Red)
  </pre>

  Test to see if you can switch to AUX in on your stereo by pressing the DISC button twice, if not then a Mercedes technician with a STAR unit can be used to recode your stereo to enable AUX in.
